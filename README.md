# Connectogen

Connectogen is a platform designed to enhance collaboration among healthcare and biomedical researchers. Initially supported by Emory University's School of Medicine (SOM) leadership, the platform is currently used by researchers and students at Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Morehouse. Connectogen allows users to create profiles, post and join research projects, manage tasks, and engage in mentorship activities. The platform is essential for connecting researchers and facilitating impactful collaborations.

# Release Notes

## Technology

For the Connectogen rebuild, we have decided to go with the MERN tech stack which consists of MongoDB for databases, Express as a framework, React for frontend, and Node.js for backend. Not only is MERN a very popular tech stack that has plenty of documentation, but MERN fits our needs for the Connectogen rebuild.

## Features

Our team will implement two main features: the Mentorship Interaction List and Extended View.

The Mentorship Interaction List presents users with a user-friendly interface where they can view a history of logged mentorship interactions, each displaying relevant details such as interaction date, meeting title, mentor, and description. The list is designed for easy navigation and allows users to quickly access and review past mentorship sessions.

We chose to implement the Mentorship Interaction List and Extended View for our first semester Project Artifact Implementation because these two features would allow us to test our full range of development (database, frontend, backend, and server framework) while being relatively straightforward. These features should give us an idea of whether or not our proposed tech stack is the correct implementation approach for the project.
